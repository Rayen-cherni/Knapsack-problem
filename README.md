# Knapsack problem

A new Flutter project.

## About The Application
This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

The backpack algorithm is a problem combinatorial optimization. It models a situation analogous to filling a bag with
back, which cannot support more than a certain weight, with all or part of a given set objects each having a weight and a value. Items put in the backpack must
maximize the total value, without exceeding the maximum weight.
